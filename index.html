        <h2 class="mb-4 mt-3">Introduction/overview</h2>
        <p>Recently I have been building a rudimentary record system for use by an education provider. In this article I
          will detail the process and methods I used for each class.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-4 mt-3">Architecture and Classes</h2>

        <p>In my classes I have used inheritance to create my class structure which is the act of using a super class
          (class a subclass is inheriting from) as a template where the subclass (class inheriting from
          the super class) has the same behaviours as the super class but can add or override them. An example of a
          basic inheritance diagram is shown in the diagram below from the
          <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/inheritance.html">official Java
            documentation</a>.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>With the use of classes, I have used encapsulation to increase the security of my code. Encapsulation is the
          use of the private keyword, getters, and setters to restrict direct access to variables. The advantage of this
          that I have taken advantage of in my program is that it provides data hiding, protecting the variables from
          external sources but other advantages that are useful but not applicable in my program include <a
            href="https://dev.to/princeibs/oop-series-encapsulation-in-java-1n51">increased
            control and reduced exceptions of the variables</a>.</p>


        <pre class="mt-2 mb-3 p-2 bg-dark text-light rounded overflow-x-auto"><code>// List of staff assigned to course
private ArrayList<String> mStaffCourseList = new ArrayList<>();

public ArrayList<String> getStaffCourseList()
{
    return mStaffCourseList;
}

public void setStaffCourseList(ArrayList<String> newCourseList)
{
    mStaffCourseList = newCourseList;
}</code></pre>


        <h3>Main Class</h3>
        <p>The main class is where the basic initialization of key properties and some generic methods takes place.</p>
        <p>The main method is called when the program runs and it’s where the Staff, Student, and Course lists are
          populated using functions in the ReadFiles class. An instance of the Menu class called menu is also
          instantiated and then the mainMenu function of the Menu class is run. </p>

        <pre class="mt-2 mb-3 p-2 bg-dark text-light rounded overflow-x-auto"><code>public static void main(String[] args)
{
    // Loads in all recorded data for each list
    Globals.StaffList = ReadFiles.readStaffFromFile();
    Globals.StudentList = ReadFiles.readStudentsFromFile();
    Globals.CourseList = ReadFiles.readCoursesFromFile();

    // Creates a new instance of the Menu class and runs the mainMenu function
    Menu menu = new Menu();
    menu.mainMenu();

    // Closes the scanner as the program ends
    Globals.ConsoleScanner.close();
}</code></pre>

        <h3>Globals Class</h3>
        <p>The Globals class contains a few variables that can be used anywhere in the program, this is done primarily
          to circumvent the lack of a dedicated database for the system and allows the program to access all stored data
          easily. These are public static so can be accessed from anywhere in the program.</p>
        <p>The scanner is created in the Globals class, parsing the values it is given. The scanner takes System.in
          which means it parses the user’s input and allows them to interact with the program. You can read more about
          the Scanner class on the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">Oracle
            official docs</a>. This uses the final keyword meaning after a value is declared, it <a
            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/final-keyword-in-java/">cannot be modified</a>, adding security as it
          should not be changed.</p>
        <p>Three ArrayList objects are created that store staff (StaffList), students (StudentList) and courses
          (CourseList) that have been recorded. These are ArrayList objects as opposed to a regular array as they must
          have a dynamic length as the program allows the creation of new staff, students, and courses and a
          <a href="https://howtodoinjava.com/java/array/array-vs-arraylist/">regular
            array has a static length and cannot be changed after initialisation</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="mt-2 mb-3 p-2 bg-dark text-light rounded overflow-x-auto"><code>public class Globals
{
    // List of all students
    public static ArrayList<Person> StudentList = new ArrayList<>();
    // List of all staff members
    public static ArrayList<Person> StaffList = new ArrayList<>();
    // List of all courses
    public static ArrayList<Course> CourseList = new ArrayList<>();

    // Global scanner class to be used wherever
    public static final Scanner ConsoleScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
}</code></pre>

        <h3>Menu Class</h3>
        <p>The menu class has all the generic menu functions. Most menus with user interaction are done using while
          loops to repeat the menu until it is not needed anymore and selection for acting upon user input. For menus I
          have used primarily switch-case statements as they are <a
            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/switch-vs-else/">faster for selection statements with more than 5
            cases</a> which will not
          affect these menus now but allows for expansion without
          having to refactor for efficiency. </p>
        <p>The login function is part of this class which uses a for loop to check through each student or staff
          member and makes a comparison between the id input and the object in that iteration of the loop to check if
          they match. If it does match, the user is prompted to enter the password, which uses a while loop and an int
          counter to allow a certain number of attempts before being returned to the main menu. To check the passwords,
          the program uses and if statement and .equals() to perform a string comparison. <a
            href="https://howtodoinjava.com/java/string/string-equals-method/">String.equals() compares the
            content of two String objects</a> therefore it is important to use this instead of == because a String is
          not a primitive
          type, it is an object so == compares the references of the strings which may be different even if the content
          of the String is equal.</p>

        <h3>Person Class</h3>
        <p>The person class is an abstract class used as a base class for system user classes to inherit from and holds
          the basic properties and methods that are used by all users. This is an abstract class which means that
          objects cannot be created off it and to create an object, <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_abstract.asp">another class must inherit it and be used to create
            the object provided the class inheriting it isn’t abstract</a>. I’ve done
          this
          because there shouldn’t be a generic person made and it provides security by hiding information from the user
          that isn’t essential to them. </p>

        <h3>Staff Class</h3>
        <p>The staff class inherits from the person class and provides the basic functionality of a staff member such as
          managing courses attached to themselves. It declares the mStaffCourseList ArrayList which contains all the
          courses attached to the staff member. </p>

        <h4>Admin Class</h4>
        <p>The admin class inherits from the staff class and adds functionality for only admins such as adding new staff
          members. It also overrides the actionMenu() method which is used to choose the action the user would like to
          make to allow the user to access the functions available to only them. This is done using method overriding
          which means the actionMenu() function declared in the staff class, the base class, <a
            href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html">is overridden and the
            function in the admin class, the subclass, is used</a>. </p>

        <h4>Teacher and Student Classes</h4>

        <p>The teacher and student classes inherit from the staff and person classes respectively and adds
          functionality only available to their class type and overrides the actionMenu() method. </p>


        <h3>Courses</h3>

        <p>The course class is a basic class that creates a structure for courses to be created, using the CourseTypes
          enum
          to determine the type of course from a static set of values.</p>

        <h3>CourseTypes</h3>

        <p>The CourseTypes is an enum which holds each type of course as constants. An enum is appropriate for this as
          there is a limited number of CourseTypes available in the program, <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4709175/what-are-enums-and-why-are-they-useful/4709224#4709224">making
            it easily readable and preventing
            any
            errors caused by passing in an invalid value</a>.</p>

        <pre class="mt-2 mb-3 p-2 bg-dark text-light rounded overflow-x-auto"><code>public enum CourseTypes
{
  HE,
  VOC,
  ALEVEL,
  TLEVEL,
  INVALID
}</code></pre>

        <h3>WriteFiles</h3>

        <p>The WriteFiles class contains static methods to write objects to files such as staff, students, and courses.
          It
          creates a new file with the file path being set to the directory passed into the function and the id of the
          object appended to it. It then creates the directory if it doesn’t already exist using mkdir(). I then created
          a
          FileWriter passing in the File created before and use that to create a new BufferedWriter. <a
            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/io-bufferedwriter-class-methods-java/">Using
            BufferedWriter
            allows efficient writing</a> by <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12350248/java-difference-between-filewriter-and-bufferedwriter/12350364#12350364">making
            less system
            calls compared to just using FileWriter if there are multiple writes before being closed</a>.</p>

        <pre class="mt-2 mb-3 p-2 bg-dark text-light rounded overflow-x-auto"><code>FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(file);
BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(fileWriter);

bufferedWriter.write(student.getID() + "\n");
bufferedWriter.write(student.getPassword() + "\n");
bufferedWriter.write(student.getFirstName() + "\n");
bufferedWriter.write(student.getSurname() + "\n");

bufferedWriter.close();</code></pre>

        <h3>ReadFiles</h3>

        <p>The ReadFiles class contains static methods that read objects from files such as staff, students, and
          courses. This and the WriteFiles class make up the basis of the record system. It creates a new ArrayList of
          the type of object it will be reading and then creates a new array of files that is set to the list of files
          found in the directory for the object type. After checking the array isn’t null, it then iterates through the
          array and reads each object individually before checking if the object returned is null, if not it then gets
          added to the global ArrayList for the object type.</p>

        <pre class="mt-2 mb-3 p-2 bg-dark text-light rounded overflow-x-auto"><code>FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(file);
BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);

String id = bufferedReader.readLine();
String password = bufferedReader.readLine();
String firstName = bufferedReader.readLine();
String surname = bufferedReader.readLine();

bufferedReader.close();</code></pre>

        <p>Individual students are read using BufferedReader over FileReader comes with multiple benefits, detailed
          below

        <h2 class="mb-4 mt-3">Testing</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>To test my system, I decided to use some unit tests which are tests that focus on individual parts of the
          system to check they all work and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unit-testing-software-testing/">help
            isolate areas of the system</a>. I have tested some key functions using JUnit 4, an open-source testing
          framework that
          <a href="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JUnit4/article.html">uses
            code annotations to identify test methods to be run</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The key functions I decided to unit test were the password checks for the login of each type of user and the
          reading and writing of files for each type of object written to a file. Ideally all functions should be tested
          in any way possible but in the interest of time, I decided to limit my testing to a few important functions.
