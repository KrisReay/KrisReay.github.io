        <h2>Introduction/overview</h2>
        <p>Recently I have been building a rudimentary record system for use by an education provider. In this article I
          will detail the process and methods I used for each class.</p>

        <h2>Architecture and classes</h2>
        <p>In my classes I have used inheritance to create my class structure which is the act of using a super class
          (the class a subclass is inheriting from) as a template where the subclass (the class that is inheriting from
          the super class) then has the same behaviours as the super class but can add or override them. An example of a
          basic inheritance diagram is shown in the diagram below from the official Java documentation. (<a
            href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/inheritance.html">What Is Inheritance? (The
            Java™ Tutorials > Learning the Java Language > Object-Oriented Programming Concepts) (oracle.com)</a>) </p>
        <p>With the use of classes, I have used encapsulation to increase the security of my code. Encapsulation is the
          use of the private keyword, getters, and setters to restrict direct access to variables. The advantage of this
          that I have taken advantage of in my program is that it provides data hiding, protecting the variables from
          external sources but other advantages that are useful but not applicable in my program include increased
          control and reduced exceptions of the variables <a
            href="https://dev.to/princeibs/oop-series-encapsulation-in-java-1n51">(OOP Series: Encapsulation In Java -
            DEV Community)</a></p>

        <h2>Main class</h2>
        <p>The main class is where the basic initialization of key properties and some generic methods takes place.</p>
        <p>The main method is called when the program runs and it’s where the Staff, Student, and Course lists are
          populated using functions in the ReadFiles class. An instance of the Menu class called menu is also
          instantiated and then the mainMenu function of the Menu class is run. </p>

        <h2>Globals class</h2>
        <p>The Globals class contains a few variables that can be used anywhere in the program, this is done primarily
          to circumvent the lack of a dedicated database for the system and allows the program to access all stored data
          easily. These are public static so can be accessed from anywhere in the program.</p>
        <p>The scanner is created in the Globals class, parsing the values it is given. The scanner takes System.in
          which means it parses the user’s input and allows them to interact with the program. You can read more about
          the Scanner class on the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">Oracle
            official docs</a>. This uses the final keyword which means after a value is declared, it cannot be modified
          elsewhere (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/final-keyword-in-java/">final Keyword in Java -
            GeeksforGeeks</a>), adding security as it should not be changed.</p>
        <p>Three ArrayList objects are created that store staff (StaffList), students (StudentList) and courses
          (CourseList) that have been recorded. These are ArrayList objects as opposed to a regular array as they must
          have a dynamic length as the program allows the creation of new staff, students, and courses and a regular
          array has a static length and cannot be changed after initialisation
          (<a
            href="https://howtodoinjava.com/java/array/array-vs-arraylist/">https://howtodoinjava.com/java/array/array-vs-arraylist/</a>).
        </p>

        <h2>Menu class</h2>
        <p>The menu class has all the generic menu functions. Most menus with user interaction are done using while
          loops to repeat the menu until it is not needed anymore and selection for acting upon user input. For menus I
          have used primarily switch-case statements as they are faster for selection statements with more than 5 cases
          (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/switch-vs-else/">switch vs if else - GeeksforGeeks</a>) which will not
          affect these menus now but allows for expansion without
          having to refactor for efficiency. </p>
        <p>The login function is also part of this class which uses a for loop to check through each student or staff
          member and makes a comparison between the id input and the object in that iteration of the loop to check if
          they match. If it does match, the user is prompted to enter the password, which uses a while loop and an int
          counter to allow a certain number of attempts before being returned to the main menu. To check the passwords,
          the program uses and if statement and .equals() to perform a string comparison. String.equals() compares the
          content of two String objects, it is important to use this instead of == because a String is not a primitive
          type, it is an object so == compares the references of the strings which may be different even if the content
          of the String is equal (<a href="https://howtodoinjava.com/java/string/string-equals-method/">Java
            String.equals() with Examples - HowToDoInJava</a>).</p>
